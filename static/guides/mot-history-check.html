Always compare the mileage progression across the full MOT history, not just the most recent reading."

It shows whether the vehicle passed or failed, what was tested, and any advisories or defects found. Service history records the maintenance and repairs carried out by garages or dealers, such as oil changes, brake pad replacements, and timing belt changes. A vehicle can have a full MOT history with no service history, or vice versa. Ideally, you want to see both when buying a used car."

            <h1>How to Check MOT History: Complete Free Guide</h1>
            <p>Checking a vehicle's MOT history is one of the most important steps you can take before buying a used car, or simply to stay on top of your own vehicle's condition. The MOT history check is completely free, takes less than a minute, and gives you a detailed record of every MOT test the vehicle has undergone since 2005. This guide explains exactly how to check MOT history, what the results mean, and how to use the information to make better decisions about your vehicle.</p>

            <p>Every year, over 30 million MOT tests are carried out across the UK. Each of those tests generates a detailed record that is stored by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) and made publicly available. Whether you are looking at a car to buy, checking up on your own vehicle, or simply curious about a vehicle's past, the MOT history record is an invaluable source of objective, verifiable information. Unlike a seller's verbal assurances, MOT history cannot be edited or falsified &mdash; it comes directly from the government database.</p>

            <p>In this guide, we cover everything you need to know about the MOT history check: how to access it, what the results show, how to interpret advisories and failures, how to spot mileage fraud, and how tools like <a href="/will-my-car-pass-mot/">AutoSafe</a> use this data to predict future MOT outcomes.</p>

            <h2>How to Check MOT History Online (Free)</h2>
            <p>The UK government provides a free, official MOT history check service through the DVSA. This is the only authoritative source of MOT data, and it is available to anyone with a vehicle's registration number. Here is how to use it step by step.</p>

            <div class="step-box">
                <h3><span class="step-number">1</span> Go to the DVSA MOT History Service</h3>
                <p>Visit the official government website at <strong>gov.uk/check-mot-history</strong>. This is the only official source for MOT history data. Avoid third-party websites that charge for information that is freely available from the government. Some paid services add value with additional vehicle checks, but the core MOT history data itself is always free.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-box">
                <h3><span class="step-number">2</span> Enter the Vehicle Registration Number</h3>
                <p>Type the vehicle's registration number (number plate) into the search box. The format does not matter &mdash; you can enter it with or without spaces (for example, AB12CDE or AB12 CDE). The system will recognise both formats. You do not need to enter any other information such as make, model, or VIN number.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-box">
                <h3><span class="step-number">3</span> Review the Results</h3>
                <p>The service will display the vehicle's complete MOT history from 2005 onwards. You will see the date of each test, whether it was a pass or fail, the recorded mileage, any advisory items noted by the tester, and any reasons for failure. The most recent test appears at the top, with older tests listed below in reverse chronological order. You can expand each test to see the full details.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can also check when the current MOT expires from the same page. If you need help understanding when your own vehicle's MOT is due, see our guide on <a href="/guides/when-is-mot-due">when your MOT is due</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What Information Does MOT History Show?</h2>
            <p>The MOT history record contains a wealth of information about a vehicle's condition over time. Understanding what each piece of data tells you is essential for getting the most value from the check. Here is a breakdown of every data point available in the MOT history record.</p>

            <h3>Test Date and Result</h3>
            <p>Each MOT test entry shows the date the test was conducted and whether the vehicle passed or failed. If the vehicle failed, you can see whether it was subsequently retested and when it eventually passed. A vehicle that has had multiple consecutive failures before passing may indicate a pattern of neglected maintenance or underlying mechanical issues that keep recurring.</p>

            <h3>Recorded Mileage</h3>
            <p>The odometer reading is recorded at every MOT test. This creates a verifiable mileage trail over the vehicle's life, which is one of the most powerful anti-fraud tools available to car buyers. We cover mileage verification in detail in a dedicated section below.</p>

            <h3>Advisory Items</h3>
            <p>Advisories are notes from the MOT tester about components that are showing wear or minor deterioration but have not yet reached the point of failure. Common advisory items include brake discs wearing thin, slight corrosion on structural components, minor oil leaks, and tyre wear approaching the legal limit. Advisories do not cause the vehicle to fail, but they serve as an early warning system. Understanding the <a href="/guides/mot-defect-categories">MOT defect categories</a> can help you interpret what each advisory means in practice.</p>

            <h3>Failure Reasons</h3>
            <p>If a vehicle failed its MOT, the specific reasons are listed in detail. Each failure item describes the component that failed, the nature of the defect, and its severity. Since the introduction of the new defect categories in 2018, failures are classified as either "Major" or "Dangerous" defects. A vehicle with a history of repeated failures on the same component &mdash; such as brakes or suspension &mdash; suggests a chronic issue that may not have been properly resolved. For more detail on what fails most often, see our guide to <a href="/guides/common-mot-failures">common MOT failure points</a>.</p>

            <h3>MOT Expiry Date</h3>
            <p>The date when the current MOT certificate expires is shown at the top of the record. Driving without a valid MOT is illegal (with limited exceptions for driving to a pre-booked test) and can result in a fine of up to one thousand pounds, invalidated insurance, and points on your licence.</p>

            <h2>How to Read Your MOT History</h2>
            <p>Knowing what data is available is one thing; understanding how to interpret it is another. Here is how to read an MOT history record effectively, whether you are checking your own vehicle or evaluating a car you are thinking of buying.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Pass Results</h3>
            <p>A pass result means the vehicle met the minimum roadworthiness standards at the time of the test. However, a pass does not mean the vehicle is in perfect condition. It simply means that no component had deteriorated below the legal threshold. A vehicle can pass its MOT with worn brakes, ageing tyres, and corroding bodywork &mdash; as long as none of these have crossed the failure line. This is why advisories matter so much: they tell you what is getting close to that line.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Advisories vs Failures</h3>
            <p>The distinction between an advisory and a failure is critical. An advisory means "this component is wearing but is still within acceptable limits." A failure means "this component has fallen below the legal minimum and must be repaired before the vehicle can pass." When reading MOT history, pay close attention to advisories that appear on one test and then become failures on the next. This pattern reveals the rate at which components are deteriorating, which is valuable information for predicting future maintenance costs.</p>

            <p>For example, if you see "Front brake disc worn but above limit" as an advisory on one test, and then "Front brake disc below minimum thickness" as a failure on the next test twelve months later, you know the brakes are wearing at a rate that requires replacement roughly every two to three years. This kind of pattern analysis is exactly what <a href="/will-my-car-pass-mot/">AutoSafe's AI prediction tool</a> automates.</p>

            <h3>Reading Multiple Tests Over Time</h3>
            <p>The real power of MOT history comes from reading it as a timeline, not as isolated snapshots. Look for these patterns across multiple tests:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recurring advisories on the same component:</strong> This suggests gradual wear that will eventually become a failure. Budget for replacement.</li>
                <li><strong>Advisory one year, failure the next:</strong> Normal wear pattern. The component was approaching end of life and was not replaced between tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Sudden appearance of multiple failures:</strong> May indicate that the vehicle was neglected for a period, or that it was involved in an incident that damaged several components simultaneously.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean test following multiple previous failures:</strong> Usually means the previous owner invested in significant repairs. This can actually be a positive sign, as it suggests the vehicle has been brought up to a good standard.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent passes with minimal advisories:</strong> The best pattern to see. Indicates a well-maintained vehicle that is regularly serviced and cared for.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why MOT History Matters When Buying a Used Car</h2>
            <p>If you are considering buying a used car, checking the MOT history should be one of the first things you do &mdash; before you even go to view the vehicle. The MOT history provides an objective, independent record of the vehicle's condition over time that cannot be falsified by the seller. Here are the specific red flags to watch for.</p>

            <div class="red-flag">
                <h3>Red Flag: Frequent Failures</h3>
                <p>A vehicle that fails its MOT regularly, particularly on different components each time, may have been poorly maintained throughout its life. While the occasional failure is normal &mdash; especially on older vehicles &mdash; a pattern of annual failures suggests the owner only fixes what is absolutely necessary to get it through the test, rather than maintaining the vehicle proactively. Compare the failure rate against typical rates for the model. You can check model-specific data in our <a href="/guides/mot-failure-rates-by-car">MOT failure rates by car</a> guide.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="red-flag">
                <h3>Red Flag: Gaps in Testing</h3>
                <p>If there is a gap of more than twelve months between MOT tests, the vehicle was either off the road (SORN), the MOT was allowed to lapse (meaning it was driven illegally), or the vehicle changed ownership and the new owner did not immediately test it. Gaps are not necessarily a problem, but you should ask the seller to explain them. A vehicle that was SORN for an extended period may have developed issues from sitting unused, such as seized brakes, flat-spotted tyres, or fuel system problems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="red-flag">
                <h3>Red Flag: Mileage Discrepancies</h3>
                <p>Any decrease in recorded mileage between tests is a serious warning sign. We cover this in detail in the mileage verification section below. Even if the mileage does not decrease, an unusually low annual mileage followed by a sudden increase can suggest the odometer was wound back at some point.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Red Flag: Structural Advisories or Failures</h3>
                <p>Corrosion advisories on structural components (sills, subframe, chassis rails, floor pan) are particularly concerning because they indicate a progressive problem that will only get worse. If you see corrosion advisories appearing on successive tests, the repair costs can escalate rapidly. A vehicle with structural corrosion failures may have required welding, and the quality of that repair work can vary enormously.</p>

                <h3>Red Flag: Test at Different Garages Each Year</h3>
                <p>While there are legitimate reasons for changing MOT test centres, a vehicle that is tested at a different garage every year may indicate the owner is "shopping around" for a lenient tester. Consistent testing at the same centre suggests the owner has a regular garage relationship, which often correlates with better overall maintenance.</p>

            <h2>MOT History and Mileage Verification</h2>
            <p>Mileage fraud &mdash; commonly known as "clocking" &mdash; remains a significant problem in the UK used car market. Estimates suggest that up to one in twelve used cars on sale has had its mileage tampered with, costing buyers hundreds of millions of pounds each year. The MOT history record is your best tool for detecting it.</p>

            <h3>How Clocking Detection Works</h3>
            <p>Because the odometer reading is recorded at every MOT test, you get a data point for each year of the vehicle's life (from its third birthday onwards). A legitimate vehicle will show a steadily increasing mileage over time, typically adding between 5,000 and 15,000 miles per year for a private car. By plotting these data points, you can quickly spot anomalies.</p>

            <h3>Signs of Mileage Tampering</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mileage goes backwards:</strong> The most obvious sign. If the recorded mileage at one test is lower than the previous test, the odometer has been wound back at some point between those dates. This is definitive proof of tampering.</li>
                <li><strong>Unusually low increase:</strong> A vehicle that shows only 1,000 miles added over twelve months, when previous years showed 10,000 to 12,000 miles per year, should raise questions. While there are legitimate explanations (lockdown periods, a period of illness, working from home), a sudden and sustained drop in annual mileage warrants investigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Mileage does not match wear:</strong> If the MOT history shows relatively low mileage but the advisory items suggest heavy wear (brake discs worn, tyres worn, suspension components tired), there may be a discrepancy between the recorded mileage and the actual distance covered.</li>
                <li><strong>Gap followed by lower-than-expected mileage:</strong> If there is a gap in testing (no MOT for a year or more) and the mileage when testing resumes is lower than you would expect based on the previous trend, the odometer may have been altered during the gap period.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In this example, the mileage drops by over 14,000 miles between 2023 and 2024. This is an unmistakable sign that the odometer was wound back, most likely before the vehicle was sold to a new owner. The buyer should walk away immediately.</p>

            <h2>How AutoSafe Uses MOT History</h2>
            <p>AutoSafe takes the raw MOT history data that is publicly available through the DVSA and transforms it into actionable predictions about your vehicle's future MOT outcome. Here is how the process works and why it is more powerful than reading the history manually.</p>

            <h3>Data Collection and Feature Engineering</h3>
            <p>When you enter your vehicle's registration number into AutoSafe, our system retrieves the complete MOT history from the DVSA database. We then extract over 100 individual features from this data, including the pattern of advisories over time, the rate of component wear, mileage trends, the vehicle's age and type, regional corrosion factors based on your postcode, and historical failure patterns for your specific make and model.</p>

            <h3>AI-Powered Prediction</h3>
            <p>These features are fed into a machine learning model that has been trained on millions of MOT test records. The model identifies patterns that are not visible to the human eye &mdash; subtle correlations between advisory types, mileage patterns, vehicle age, and eventual failure outcomes. The result is a personalised failure risk score for your vehicle, along with a component-level breakdown showing which parts are most likely to cause problems.</p>

            <h3>Practical Application</h3>
            <p>Rather than spending twenty minutes reading through years of MOT history and trying to work out what it all means, AutoSafe gives you a clear, data-driven answer in seconds. You get a percentage risk score, a list of the components most likely to fail, estimated repair costs, and a confidence interval based on how much data is available for your specific vehicle. This is particularly valuable when you are viewing a used car and need to make a quick, informed decision. You can check any vehicle for free using our <a href="/will-my-car-pass-mot/">MOT prediction tool</a>.</p>

            <h2>MOT History for Different Vehicle Types</h2>
            <p>The way you interpret MOT history can vary depending on the type of vehicle you are looking at. Different vehicles have different typical wear patterns, and what counts as normal for one type may be a red flag for another.</p>

            <h3>Low-Mileage Vehicles</h3>
            <p>A vehicle with very low annual mileage (under 3,000 miles per year) presents a unique set of concerns. While the low mileage means less mechanical wear, vehicles that sit unused for extended periods can develop problems of their own: seized brakes, perished rubber seals, corroded exhaust systems, and flat-spotted tyres. If the MOT history shows a low-mileage vehicle with advisories for corrosion or brake issues, these are likely related to inactivity rather than heavy use. This is common with second cars, vehicles owned by elderly drivers, and seasonal vehicles.</p>

            <h3>High-Mileage Vehicles</h3>
            <p>A vehicle with high annual mileage (over 15,000 miles per year) will show more wear-related advisories, particularly on brakes, tyres, and suspension components. However, high-mileage vehicles that have been well-maintained often have fewer corrosion and emission issues because the regular use keeps components active and fluids circulating. A high-mileage <a href="/mot-check/volkswagen/golf/">Volkswagen Golf</a> or <a href="/mot-check/ford/focus/">Ford Focus</a> with consistent pass results and only minor advisories is often a better buy than a low-mileage example with gaps in testing and corrosion issues.</p>

            <h3>Diesel Vehicles</h3>
            <p>Diesel vehicles deserve special attention when reviewing MOT history. Since the introduction of stricter emissions testing in 2018, diesel particulate filter (DPF) failures have become a significant issue, particularly for vehicles used primarily for short urban journeys. If you see emissions-related advisories or failures in the MOT history of a diesel vehicle, this can be an expensive problem to resolve, with DPF replacement costing anywhere from five hundred to two thousand pounds. Our guide on <a href="/guides/common-mot-failures">common MOT failures</a> covers emissions issues in detail.</p>

            <h3>Older and Classic Vehicles</h3>
            <p>Vehicles over 15 years old tend to have longer MOT histories with more data to analyse. Corrosion is the primary concern for older vehicles, and the MOT history will show how this has progressed over time. A vehicle that has had minor corrosion advisories for several years without progressing to failure is likely being monitored and treated. A vehicle where corrosion advisories suddenly escalate into structural failures may have reached the point where repairs become uneconomical.</p>

            <h2>Beyond MOT History: Additional Checks</h2>
            <p>While MOT history is an excellent starting point, it should be part of a broader set of checks when evaluating a vehicle. The MOT test only covers roadworthiness &mdash; it does not check the engine, gearbox, clutch (except for the pedal), air conditioning, or many electrical systems. Here are the other checks you should perform alongside the MOT history review:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>HPI or provenance check:</strong> Verifies the vehicle has not been stolen, written off, or has outstanding finance. This is a separate paid service and covers information that MOT history does not.</li>
                <li><strong>Service history:</strong> Shows what maintenance has been carried out between MOT tests. A vehicle with full service history and clean MOT records is the ideal combination.</li>
                <li><strong>V5C logbook check:</strong> Confirms the seller is the registered keeper and the vehicle details match the MOT history.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical inspection:</strong> No amount of online checking replaces a thorough in-person inspection, ideally by an independent mechanic.</li>
                <li><strong>AutoSafe risk check:</strong> Combines MOT history with make, model, and regional data to give a comprehensive risk prediction. <a href="/will-my-car-pass-mot/">Check your vehicle here</a>.</li>
            </ul>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I check MOT history for free?</h3>
                    <p>You can check MOT history for free using the official DVSA service at gov.uk. Go to gov.uk/check-mot-history, enter the vehicle's registration number, and you will see a complete record of every MOT test the vehicle has had since 2005. This includes pass and fail results, advisory items, failure reasons, recorded mileage at each test, and the expiry date of the current MOT certificate. The service is completely free and available 24 hours a day.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How far back does MOT history go?</h3>
                    <p>The DVSA MOT history service holds records going back to 2005 when the digital recording system was introduced. Any MOT test conducted from 2005 onwards should appear in the system. Tests before 2005 were recorded on paper and are not available online. For most used car purchases, the records from 2005 onwards provide more than enough history to assess the vehicle's condition and maintenance pattern over time.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I check MOT history without the registration number?</h3>
                    <p>No, you need the vehicle's registration number to check its MOT history through the official DVSA service. The registration number is the only search field available. If you do not have the registration number, you may be able to find it on the V5C logbook, any previous insurance documents, or by asking the seller directly. There is no way to search MOT history by VIN number, chassis number, or owner name through the official service.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What does an MOT advisory mean?</h3>
                    <p>An MOT advisory is a note from the tester about a component that is showing wear or minor deterioration but has not yet reached the point of failure. Advisories do not cause the vehicle to fail its MOT, but they serve as an early warning that the component may need attention before the next test. Common advisories include brake discs wearing thin, slight tyre wear, minor corrosion, and oil leaks that are not yet dripping. Advisories from previous tests are one of the strongest predictors of what will fail on the next MOT.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can MOT history show if a car has been clocked?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, MOT history is one of the most reliable ways to detect mileage fraud, also known as clocking. Because the mileage is recorded at every MOT test, you can track whether the odometer reading has increased consistently over the years. If the mileage ever decreases between tests, or if there is an unusually small increase over several years followed by a sudden jump, this is a strong indicator that the odometer has been tampered with. Always compare the mileage progression across the full MOT history, not just the most recent reading.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is MOT history the same as service history?</h3>
                    <p>No, MOT history and service history are different things. MOT history records the results of the annual roadworthiness test required by law for vehicles over three years old. It shows whether the vehicle passed or failed, what was tested, and any advisories or defects found. Service history records the maintenance and repairs carried out by garages or dealers, such as oil changes, brake pad replacements, and timing belt changes. A vehicle can have a full MOT history with no service history, or vice versa. Ideally, you want to see both when buying a used car.</p>
