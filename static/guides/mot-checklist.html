If the failure is for a dangerous defect, you must not drive the car on public roads until it is repaired. If it fails on major defects that are not dangerous, you may still drive it if your previous MOT certificate has not yet expired. A partial retest only covers the items that caused the failure, saving time and often money."

            <h1>Pre-MOT Checklist: 15 Things to Check Before Your MOT Test</h1>
            <p>Around 40% of vehicles fail their MOT on the first attempt. Many of these failures are for simple issues you can check yourself. Use this checklist before your MOT to catch problems early and increase your chances of passing first time.</p>

            <p>The good news is that a significant proportion of these failures could be avoided with a 20-to-30-minute check at home. By working through each category below, you will cover the areas that account for the vast majority of MOT failures across the UK. Whether your car is three years old and facing its first test or a 15-year-old veteran, this checklist applies equally.</p>

            <h2>Lights and Signals</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Headlights:</strong> Check both dipped and main beam work. Look for cracks, chips, or condensation in the lens. Condensation inside the headlight unit does not automatically fail, but if it is heavy enough to obscure the beam pattern, it will. On older vehicles, check that the headlight aim has not shifted &mdash; testers use a beam aligner, and misaligned headlights are a common fail.</li>
                <li><strong>Brake lights:</strong> Ask someone to press the brake pedal while you check all brake lights illuminate. This includes the high-level brake light if your vehicle is fitted with one. Make sure each light comes on promptly and at full brightness.</li>
                <li><strong>Indicators:</strong> Test all four indicators and hazard lights. They should flash at the correct rate &mdash; a rapid flash usually indicates a blown bulb elsewhere in the circuit. Check that the indicator lenses are not cracked or missing.</li>
                <li><strong>Rear lights and number plate light:</strong> Ensure all rear lights work and the number plate is clearly illuminated. The number plate light is one of the most overlooked items and is a frequent cause of failure, particularly on hatchbacks and estate cars where the boot-mounted light can be easily damaged.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="stat-callout">
                <p><strong>DVSA statistic:</strong> Lighting and signalling faults account for approximately 18% of all MOT failures, making them the single biggest reason vehicles fail. <a href="/mot-check/ford/fiesta/">Ford Fiesta</a> owners should pay extra attention to rear light clusters, which are a known weak point on Mk7 and Mk7.5 models.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Tyres and Wheels</h2>
            <ol start="5">
                <li><strong>Tread depth:</strong> Legal minimum is 1.6mm across the central three-quarters. Use a 20p coin &mdash; if you can see the outer band, tyres may be illegal. Check the tread depth at several points around each tyre, as uneven wear can mean one section is below the limit while another appears fine.</li>
                <li><strong>Tyre condition:</strong> Check for cuts, bulges, or cracks in the sidewall. These are automatic failures. Run your hand along the inner sidewall as well, since damage here is easy to miss visually. Also check that both tyres on the same axle are the same type (radial or cross-ply) &mdash; mixing types on the same axle is an MOT failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Tyre pressure:</strong> While not tested directly, incorrect pressure affects handling and wear patterns. Under-inflated tyres wear on the edges and can cause the vehicle to pull to one side, while over-inflation causes centre-tread wear. Check pressures when the tyres are cold, using the manufacturer's recommended figures (usually found inside the driver's door frame or in the owner's manual).</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="stat-callout">
                <p><strong>DVSA statistic:</strong> Tyre-related issues account for around 9% of MOT failures. The most common tyre failure is insufficient tread depth, followed by sidewall damage. SUVs and heavier vehicles like the <a href="/mot-check/nissan/qashqai/">Nissan Qashqai</a> can wear tyres unevenly if wheel alignment is neglected.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Visibility</h2>
            <ol start="8">
                <li><strong>Windscreen:</strong> Check for chips or cracks. Damage larger than 10mm in the driver's view (Zone A &mdash; a 290mm-wide strip centred on the steering wheel) or 40mm elsewhere in the swept area will fail. Small chips outside the driver's direct view are usually acceptable, but get them repaired early before they spread in cold weather.</li>
                <li><strong>Wipers:</strong> Blades should clear the screen without smearing or juddering. Replace if worn. Wiper blades deteriorate over time even when not in use, so replace them at least once a year. Check that the wiper arms have not become loose or bent, which can cause uneven pressure across the blade.</li>
                <li><strong>Washer fluid:</strong> Top up the washer bottle. The system must work during the test. The tester will check that the washers deliver fluid to the windscreen and that the wipers then clear it effectively. Use a proper screenwash additive rather than plain water, especially in colder months, to prevent the system freezing.</li>
                <li><strong>Mirrors:</strong> All mirrors must be present, secure, and provide adequate rear view. The interior mirror and both door mirrors will be checked. Cracked mirror glass is not an automatic failure, but if it distorts the view significantly, it may be. Loose or wobbly mirror housings are a common advisory that can become a failure.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="stat-callout">
                <p><strong>DVSA statistic:</strong> Driver's view issues (including windscreen, wipers, and mirrors) cause about 8% of all MOT failures. Windscreen chips are the most easily preventable &mdash; most insurance policies cover chip repairs at no cost to you.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Under the Bonnet</h2>
            <ol start="12">
                <li><strong>Oil level:</strong> Check and top up if needed. Low oil can cause engine warning lights, and if the engine management light is illuminated on the dashboard, your vehicle will receive at least an advisory. On diesel vehicles, particularly, low oil can affect the diesel particulate filter (DPF) regeneration process.</li>
                <li><strong>Brake fluid:</strong> Should be between min and max marks. If low, there may be a leak or worn pads. Dark or discoloured brake fluid may indicate it needs replacing, though this is not directly tested in the MOT. However, degraded brake fluid can lead to poor braking performance, which is tested.</li>
                <li><strong>Horn:</strong> Must be loud enough to warn other road users. Press the horn and listen &mdash; it should produce a clear, continuous tone. Horns that sound weak or intermittent will fail. On some cars, particularly those exposed to damp conditions, the horn can corrode and lose effectiveness over time.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Safety Equipment</h2>
            <ol start="15">
                <li><strong>Seatbelts:</strong> Check all belts for damage, that they retract properly, and buckles click securely. Pull each belt out fully and inspect for fraying, cuts, or twisting. The buckle should release cleanly when the button is pressed. Test the inertia reel by giving the belt a sharp tug &mdash; it should lock immediately. Seatbelt failures account for around 3% of all MOT failures, and many are caused by buckles clogged with debris from children's snacks or general dirt.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="cta-box">
                <h3>Want to know your specific failure risks?</h3>
                <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Enter your registration to see which components are most likely to fail based on your vehicle's history.</p>
                <a href="/">Check Your MOT Risk Free</a>
            </div>

            <h2>Digital Checklist</h2>
            <p>While a physical walk-around is essential, digital tools can add another layer of preparation. <a href="/will-my-car-pass-mot/">AutoSafe's free MOT prediction tool</a> analyses your vehicle's make, model, age, mileage, and full MOT history to identify its specific weak points. Rather than checking a generic list, you can focus your attention on the components that are statistically most likely to cause your particular vehicle to fail.</p>
            <p>For example, if AutoSafe identifies that your 2016 <a href="/mot-check/vauxhall/corsa/">Vauxhall Corsa</a> has a high risk of suspension failure, you know to pay particular attention to any knocking sounds or uneven tyre wear before booking your MOT. This targeted approach is far more efficient than a blanket inspection, though we still recommend working through the full 15-point checklist above regardless.</p>
            <p>The tool also shows your vehicle's full MOT history, including all previous advisories. Advisories from your last MOT are the single best predictor of what might fail next time, so reviewing them before your test is one of the most valuable things you can do.</p>

            <h2>What Testers Look For (That You Might Miss)</h2>
            <p>The official MOT test covers far more than the 15 items above. Here are additional areas that testers examine which motorists frequently overlook:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exhaust emissions:</strong> Your vehicle's exhaust emissions are measured during the test. Diesel vehicles are checked for smoke opacity, while petrol vehicles have their CO and hydrocarbon levels measured. A 20-minute motorway drive before the test helps the catalytic converter and DPF reach optimal operating temperature, significantly improving your chances of passing. Vehicles with a DPF that has been removed or tampered with will receive an automatic major failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Seat condition:</strong> The driver's seat must be securely mounted and the backrest must lock in the upright position. Testers will check for excessive movement in the seat runners and ensure the adjustment mechanism works. This is particularly worth checking on high-mileage vehicles where the seat rails can wear.</li>
                <li><strong>Registration plates:</strong> Both front and rear plates must be present, legible, and conform to the correct format. Faded, cracked, or illegally spaced plates will fail. Number plate fixings should be secure &mdash; plates held on with adhesive pads that are peeling away are a common issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel cap:</strong> The fuel filler cap must seal properly to prevent fuel vapour escaping. A damaged or missing seal on the fuel cap is a straightforward failure that costs very little to fix but catches many motorists off guard.</li>
                <li><strong>Doors and boot:</strong> All doors must open and close securely from both inside and outside. The bonnet catch must hold the bonnet closed while driving. Boot and tailgate latches are also checked.</li>
                <li><strong>Exhaust system:</strong> Beyond emissions, the physical condition of the exhaust is examined. Holes, excessive corrosion, and insecure mountings are all failure points. Listen for blowing or rattling sounds underneath the car, particularly when the engine is running.</li>
                <li><strong>Fluid leaks:</strong> Significant fluid leaks (oil, coolant, brake fluid) are MOT failures if they pose a risk. Check your usual parking spot for puddles or stains underneath the vehicle.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common DIY Fixes Before Your MOT</h2>
            <p>Many of the most common MOT failures can be fixed at home with basic tools and minimal cost. Here are the easiest wins:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bulb replacement:</strong> A blown bulb is the single most common reason for MOT failure, yet replacing one typically costs between two and eight pounds and takes five to fifteen minutes. Most modern cars allow bulb access from behind the headlight unit under the bonnet. Carry spare bulbs in your glovebox so you can replace them as soon as you notice a failure. If you are unsure about the bulb type, your owner's manual or any motor factor will be able to advise.</li>
                <li><strong>Wiper blades:</strong> Worn or split wiper blades are an easy replacement. New blades cost between eight and fifteen pounds per pair from any motor factor or supermarket. They clip or slide onto the wiper arm and take less than five minutes to fit. Test them with the washer fluid to make sure they clear the screen cleanly.</li>
                <li><strong>Washer fluid:</strong> Topping up screenwash costs a couple of pounds and takes thirty seconds. If the washer jets are blocked, a pin or needle can clear them. Adjust the jet aim so fluid hits the centre of the windscreen.</li>
                <li><strong>Tyre pressure:</strong> Use a tyre pressure gauge or a free airline at a petrol station. Correct pressure improves handling, fuel economy, and tyre life. Check your pressures when the tyres are cold for an accurate reading.</li>
                <li><strong>Number plate bulbs:</strong> Often overlooked, number plate bulbs are cheap (under two pounds) and usually accessible by removing a small lens cover with a screwdriver. This is one of the quickest fixes you can make.</li>
                <li><strong>Registration plate condition:</strong> If your plates are faded or cracked, replacement plates cost around fifteen to twenty pounds per pair from a registered number plate supplier. You will need your V5C document as proof of entitlement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Happens If You Fail?</h2>
            <p>If your car fails its MOT, don't panic. You have several options depending on the severity of the defects found:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Get repairs done at the testing centre:</strong> Many MOT centres also offer repairs. If you have the work done on site, you can request a partial retest that only covers the failed items. This is often the quickest and most convenient option.</li>
                <li><strong>Take it elsewhere for repairs:</strong> You can have repairs done at a different garage and return to the original testing centre within 10 working days for a free partial retest. This only applies if the vehicle is returned to the same testing station that conducted the original test.</li>
                <li><strong>Full retest:</strong> If you return after 10 working days, or go to a different testing station, you will need to pay for a full retest. The maximum fee for a full retest is the same as the original MOT fee.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Understanding defect categories:</strong> Since May 2018, MOT defects are classified into three categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minor defects:</strong> Issues that do not affect the vehicle's safety or environmental impact significantly. The vehicle passes with advisories noted on the certificate. No repair is legally required, but it is recommended.</li>
                <li><strong>Major defects:</strong> Problems that may affect safety, put other road users at risk, or have an impact on the environment. The vehicle fails and must be repaired. You may still drive the car if your previous MOT certificate has not expired.</li>
                <li><strong>Dangerous defects:</strong> Serious issues that pose a direct and immediate risk. The vehicle fails and <strong>must not be driven on public roads</strong> until the defect is rectified. Driving a vehicle with a dangerous defect is a criminal offence.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Partial retest rules:</strong> A partial retest covers only the items that failed. If you leave the vehicle at the testing station overnight and collect it the next day after repairs, the partial retest is free. If you drive the vehicle away and bring it back within 10 working days, the partial retest is also free at the original station, but the tester may re-examine items that could have been affected by driving the vehicle (such as brakes or tyres). After 10 working days, you will need a full retest.</p>

            <p>The best approach is prevention. Use <a href="/will-my-car-pass-mot/">AutoSafe</a> to identify your vehicle's weak points before booking your MOT, so you can address issues proactively. Drivers who fix known advisories and risk areas before their test save an average of 30-50% on total repair costs compared to those who only discover problems at the testing station.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What should I check before my MOT?</h3>
                    <p>Before your MOT, you should check all lights and signals (headlights, brake lights, indicators, number plate light), tyre tread depth and condition, windscreen for chips or cracks, wiper blades and washer fluid, mirrors, seatbelts, horn, exhaust condition, and brake fluid level. A thorough walk-around inspection covering these 15 key areas can catch the majority of common MOT failure points before you arrive at the testing station.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I do a pre-MOT check myself?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, you can perform a comprehensive pre-MOT check yourself at home. Most of the 15 items on the standard checklist require no specialist tools or knowledge. You can check lights by asking someone to operate them while you walk around the car, test tyre tread with a 20p coin, inspect the windscreen for damage, and verify seatbelts retract properly. The only areas you may struggle to assess without equipment are brake pad thickness and suspension wear, though unusual noises can indicate problems.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What are the most common things to fail on?</h3>
                    <p>The most common MOT failure points are lighting and signalling faults (accounting for around 18% of all failures), followed by suspension issues (12%), brakes (10%), tyres (9%), and driver's view obstructions including windscreen damage and worn wipers (8%). Many of these are straightforward to check and fix yourself before your test, which is why a pre-MOT checklist is so valuable.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much does it cost to fix MOT failures?</h3>
                    <p>The cost to fix MOT failures varies widely depending on the issue. Simple fixes like replacing a blown bulb cost under five pounds and can be done at home. Wiper blades typically cost eight to fifteen pounds per pair. More significant repairs such as new brake pads and discs can range from one hundred to three hundred pounds per axle, while suspension work such as replacing shock absorbers might cost two hundred to five hundred pounds. On average, UK drivers spend around one hundred and fifty pounds on MOT-related repairs each year.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What happens if my car fails its MOT?</h3>
                    <p>If your car fails its MOT, you can either have repairs done at the testing centre and request a partial retest, or take it elsewhere for repairs and return within 10 working days for a free retest at the original centre. If the failure is for a dangerous defect, you must not drive the car on public roads until it is repaired. If it fails on major defects that are not dangerous, you may still drive it if your previous MOT certificate has not yet expired. A partial retest only covers the items that caused the failure, saving time and often money.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does a pre-MOT check take?</h3>
                    <p>A thorough pre-MOT check at home typically takes between 20 and 30 minutes. This includes walking around the vehicle to check all lights, inspecting tyres for tread depth and damage, testing wipers and washer fluid, checking mirrors and seatbelts, and listening for any unusual sounds from the horn and engine. If you find issues that need fixing, allow additional time for repairs or to book the car into a garage before your MOT appointment.</p>
