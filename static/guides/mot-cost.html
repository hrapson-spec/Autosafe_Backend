Many national chains like Halfords Autocentres and Kwik Fit periodically offer free MOT tests, usually as part of a promotion or when combined with a paid service. Some independent garages also offer a free MOT when you book a full service. These offers are genuine — the test itself is conducted to the same DVSA standard regardless of the price."

The average repair bill after an MOT failure is between £150 and £300, depending on what has failed. If you return to the same testing centre within 10 working days, you are entitled to a free partial retest on the failed items.

            "text": "Dedicated MOT test centres (sometimes called VOSA or DVSA test centres) do not necessarily charge less for the test itself, as prices vary between individual businesses. However, test-only centres can be a good option because they have no financial incentive to find unnecessary repairs — they only carry out the MOT test and do not perform repair work. This means you can get an unbiased assessment, then shop around for the best repair price if your vehicle fails."

If you return to the same testing centre that carried out the original MOT within 10 working days, you are entitled to a free partial retest covering only the items that failed. If you leave the vehicle at the test centre overnight and it is retested the next working day, the full retest is free. If you go to a different testing centre, or if more than 10 working days have passed, you will need to pay for a complete new MOT test."

            <h1>How Much Does an MOT Cost in 2026? The Complete Guide</h1>
            <p>The MOT test has a government-set maximum fee, but the test itself is often the cheapest part. For most drivers, the real cost of an MOT comes from the repair bill if your vehicle fails. This guide breaks down every cost you might encounter, from the test fee to typical repair prices, plus practical tips for keeping your MOT bill as low as possible.</p>

            <h2>The MOT Test Fee</h2>
            <p>The DVSA (Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency) sets the <strong>maximum</strong> fee that testing centres can charge for an MOT. These are not recommended prices &mdash; they are legal maximums. Most garages charge less.</p>

            <table class="data-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Vehicle Type</th>
                        <th>Maximum MOT Fee</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Cars (up to 8 passenger seats)</td>
                        <td><strong>&pound;54.85</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Motorcycles</td>
                        <td><strong>&pound;29.65</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Motorhomes (up to 3,000kg DGW)</td>
                        <td><strong>&pound;54.85</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Motorhomes (over 3,000kg DGW)</td>
                        <td><strong>&pound;58.60</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Motor caravans</td>
                        <td><strong>&pound;54.85</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Three-wheeled vehicles</td>
                        <td><strong>&pound;37.80</strong></td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>In practice, the majority of garages charge between <strong>&pound;30 and &pound;45</strong> for a car MOT. Competition between garages, especially national chains, keeps prices well below the maximum. Many garages also offer a <strong>free MOT</strong> when you book a full service at the same time.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Money-saving tip:</strong> Search online for "MOT near me" and compare prices. Aggregator sites and garage booking platforms often show live prices, making it easy to find the best deal in your area.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Real Cost of an MOT: Repair Bills</h2>
            <p>The test fee is a small, predictable cost. The real financial sting comes if your vehicle fails and needs repairs. Around <strong>1 in 4 vehicles</strong> fail their MOT each year, and the repair bill can vary enormously depending on what has failed.</p>

            <div class="stat-highlight">
                <div class="big-number">&pound;54.85 vs &pound;250</div>
                <div class="label">The test fee is &pound;54.85 max. The average repair bill after failing is &pound;150&ndash;&pound;300.</div>
            </div>

            <p>Here is a breakdown of typical repair costs for the most common MOT failure items:</p>

            <p>Costs vary significantly depending on your vehicle's make and model. German premium brands (BMW, Mercedes, Audi) tend to have higher parts costs, while common models from Ford, Vauxhall, and Volkswagen typically have cheaper, more readily available parts.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Watch out:</strong> Some garages inflate repair quotes when they know your car has failed. Always ask for an itemised quote and do not feel pressured to have the work done on the spot. You have <strong>10 working days</strong> to get a free partial retest at the same centre.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>How to Reduce Your MOT Costs</h2>
            <p>The cheapest MOT failure is the one that never happens. Here are proven ways to reduce what you spend:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Get a pre-MOT check:</strong> Many garages offer a pre-MOT inspection for &pound;20&ndash;&pound;30. This identifies likely failures before the test, so you can fix them in advance and avoid the retest process entirely</li>
                <li><strong>Use AutoSafe's prediction tool:</strong> Enter your registration to see which components are most likely to fail based on your vehicle's specific make, model, age, and MOT history. This lets you target your preparation</li>
                <li><strong>Address last year's advisories:</strong> Advisory items from your previous MOT are the biggest clue to what might fail next time. Check your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-mot-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MOT history online</a> and fix advisory items before the test</li>
                <li><strong>Compare garage prices:</strong> Get quotes from 2&ndash;3 garages for both the test and any expected repairs. Prices can vary by 50% or more for the same work</li>
                <li><strong>Book MOT with a service:</strong> Many garages offer bundle discounts &mdash; a full service plus MOT for a fixed price. This often works out cheaper than booking separately and has the added benefit of the service catching potential MOT failures</li>
                <li><strong>Do simple checks yourself:</strong> Our <a href="/static/guides/mot-checklist.html">pre-MOT checklist</a> covers items you can check at home, such as lights, tyres, wipers, and washer fluid. Fixing a blown bulb yourself costs &pound;5; having a garage do it after an MOT failure could cost &pound;20&ndash;&pound;30 in labour</li>
                <li><strong>Drive before your test:</strong> A 20-minute motorway drive before a diesel MOT helps the catalytic converter and DPF reach optimal temperature, reducing the chance of an emissions failure</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Free and Discounted MOTs</h2>
            <p>It is genuinely possible to pay nothing for your MOT test. Here are the most common ways:</p>

            <h3>National Chain Offers</h3>
            <p>Major chains regularly run MOT promotions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Halfords Autocentres:</strong> Frequently offer free MOTs with any service booking. They also run seasonal promotions for half-price or free standalone MOTs</li>
                <li><strong>Kwik Fit:</strong> Often have discounted MOT offers, particularly when booking online. Free MOT with service is a common promotion</li>
                <li><strong>ATS Euromaster:</strong> Regular online-only MOT deals, sometimes as low as &pound;20</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Free MOT with Service</h3>
            <p>This is the most widely available way to get a free MOT. When you book a full or interim service, many garages include the MOT at no extra charge. Since most vehicles need an annual service anyway, this effectively makes the MOT free. The service typically costs &pound;150&ndash;&pound;250 depending on the level, but you would be paying that regardless.</p>

            <h3>MOT Test Centres vs Full-Service Garages</h3>
            <p>Dedicated MOT-only test centres (sometimes called "test-only" centres) do not carry out repairs. Their advantage is impartiality &mdash; they have no incentive to find unnecessary faults because they do not profit from the repair work. However, if your car fails, you will need to take it elsewhere for repairs and then return for the retest.</p>

            <h2>What If You Can't Afford the Repairs?</h2>
            <p>An unexpected MOT failure can be a financial strain, especially if the repair bill runs into hundreds of pounds. Here are your options:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Payment plans:</strong> Some larger garages and chains offer interest-free payment plans for repair work, spreading the cost over several months. Ask before agreeing to the repairs</li>
                <li><strong>Prioritise safety-critical items:</strong> If you have multiple failures, focus on the items that are cheapest to fix first. A blown bulb (&pound;5&ndash;&pound;10) is just as much of a failure as a worn steering rack (&pound;400+), and fixing the easy items reduces your retest scope</li>
                <li><strong>Use the 10-day retest window:</strong> You do not need to fix everything at the testing centre. Take the failure report, shop around for the best repair prices, and return within 10 working days for a <strong>free partial retest</strong></li>
                <li><strong>"Leave and return" option:</strong> If you fail with a dangerous defect and cannot afford immediate repair, you can leave the vehicle at the testing centre and arrange for repairs. Some garages will store the vehicle for a few days at no charge</li>
                <li><strong>DIY where possible:</strong> Some MOT repairs are straightforward enough to do yourself. Bulb replacement, wiper blade changes, and topping up washer fluid are all things most people can manage. For more complex items, online guides and forums specific to your car model can help</li>
                <li><strong>Get multiple quotes:</strong> The first quote you receive is rarely the cheapest. Independent garages are often 30&ndash;50% cheaper than main dealers for the same work</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Never be tempted to drive without a valid MOT to save money. The potential costs of being caught &mdash; a fine of up to &pound;1,000, invalidated insurance, and possible vehicle seizure &mdash; far outweigh the repair bill.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much is an MOT in 2026?</h3>
                    <p>The maximum MOT test fee for cars in 2026 is &pound;54.85, set by the DVSA. However, most garages charge less than this &mdash; typically between &pound;30 and &pound;45. Some garages offer free MOTs when you book a service at the same time. For motorcycles, the maximum fee is &pound;29.65, and for motorhomes the maximum is &pound;54.85 (or &pound;58.60 for vehicles over 3,000kg design gross weight).</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I get a free MOT?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, it is possible to get a free MOT. Many national chains like Halfords Autocentres and Kwik Fit periodically offer free MOT tests, usually as part of a promotion or when combined with a paid service. Some independent garages also offer a free MOT when you book a full service. These offers are genuine &mdash; the test itself is conducted to the same DVSA standard regardless of the price.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much does it cost if you fail your MOT?</h3>
                    <p>If you fail your MOT, there is no additional fee for the failure itself &mdash; you only pay the original test fee. However, you will need to pay for the repairs to fix the failed items, which is where the real cost lies. The average repair bill after an MOT failure is between &pound;150 and &pound;300, depending on what has failed. If you return to the same testing centre within 10 working days, you are entitled to a free partial retest on the failed items. If you go to a different centre, you will need to pay for a full retest.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is it cheaper to get MOT at a test centre?</h3>
                    <p>Dedicated MOT test centres (sometimes called VOSA or DVSA test centres) do not necessarily charge less for the test itself, as prices vary between individual businesses. However, test-only centres can be a good option because they have no financial incentive to find unnecessary repairs &mdash; they only carry out the MOT test and do not perform repair work. This means you can get an unbiased assessment, then shop around for the best repair price if your vehicle fails.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you have to pay for a retest?</h3>
                    <p>It depends on where and when you have the retest. If you return to the same testing centre that carried out the original MOT within 10 working days, you are entitled to a free partial retest covering only the items that failed. If you leave the vehicle at the test centre overnight and it is retested the next working day, the full retest is free. If you go to a different testing centre, or if more than 10 working days have passed, you will need to pay for a complete new MOT test.</p>
