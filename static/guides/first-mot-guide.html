            <h1>Your First MOT: Everything You Need to Know</h1>
            <p>If your car is approaching its third birthday, you're about to encounter the MOT test for the first time. While it might seem daunting, the MOT is a straightforward annual safety check &mdash; and with a bit of preparation, most vehicles pass without any issues.</p>

            <p>This guide covers everything first-time MOT owners need to know: when your test is due, what happens on the day, how to prepare, and what to do if things don't go to plan.</p>

            <div class="stat-highlight">
                <div class="big-number">~15%</div>
                <div class="label">of vehicles fail their first MOT at 3 years old</div>
            </div>

            <h2>When Is Your First MOT Due?</h2>
            <p>New cars in the UK are exempt from the MOT test for the first <strong>3 years</strong> after their date of first registration. This date is shown on your V5C logbook (registration document) and is the date the vehicle was first registered with the DVLA &mdash; not necessarily when you bought it.</p>

            <p>Your first MOT must be completed by the <strong>third anniversary</strong> of your registration date. After that, an annual MOT is required every year.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your car was first registered on 15 March 2023, your first MOT is due by 14 March 2026. You can book it up to one month early (from 15 February 2026) without losing any validity &mdash; your next MOT will still be due from the original expiry date.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Important for second-hand buyers:</strong> If you bought a car that's less than 3 years old, the MOT due date is based on when the car was <em>first registered</em>, not when you purchased it. Check your V5C logbook or use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-mot-history" style="color: #e5c07b;" rel="noopener">DVSA online checker</a> to confirm.</p>

            <h2>What Does the MOT Test Check?</h2>
            <p>The MOT is a comprehensive inspection covering over <strong>100 individual checks</strong> across your vehicle. A qualified tester will examine:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lights and signalling:</strong> All exterior lights including headlights (dipped and main beam), brake lights, indicators, fog lights, hazard lights, and number plate lights</li>
                <li><strong>Steering:</strong> Steering column, rack, linkages, power steering operation, and steering wheel condition</li>
                <li><strong>Suspension:</strong> Shock absorbers, springs, wishbones, anti-roll bars, and all associated bushes and mountings</li>
                <li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Brake pads, discs, drums, lines, hoses, handbrake operation, and braking efficiency on a roller test</li>
                <li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Tread depth (minimum 1.6mm), condition, correct size, and type matching</li>
                <li><strong>Seatbelts:</strong> Condition, retraction, and locking mechanism for all fitted belts</li>
                <li><strong>Windscreen and wipers:</strong> Damage in the driver's line of sight, wiper operation, and washer function</li>
                <li><strong>Exhaust and emissions:</strong> Exhaust system condition, catalytic converter presence, and emissions levels (petrol and diesel)</li>
                <li><strong>Body and structure:</strong> Corrosion, sharp edges, structural integrity, and door operation</li>
                <li><strong>Mirrors:</strong> Presence, condition, and adjustment of all required mirrors</li>
                <li><strong>Horn:</strong> Audibility and correct operation</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel system:</strong> Leaks, fuel cap security, and fuel lines</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What the MOT does NOT check:</strong> The test doesn't assess engine condition, clutch operation, gearbox function, air conditioning, or general mechanical performance. A car can pass its MOT and still have significant mechanical issues.</p>

            <h2>How to Prepare for Your First MOT</h2>
            <p>Despite being only 3 years old, approximately <strong>15% of vehicles fail their first MOT</strong>. That's roughly 1 in 7 nearly-new cars. The good news? Most first-MOT failures are for simple, easily-preventable issues.</p>

            <h3>Most common first-MOT failures</h3>
            <p>At the 3-year mark, the most frequent failure points are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Lighting and signalling (40% of first-MOT failures):</strong> Blown bulbs are by far the most common issue. Modern cars have many individual bulbs, and it's easy to miss one that's gone. Check every light &mdash; including the number plate light, which is often forgotten.</li>
                <li><strong>Tyres (20% of first-MOT failures):</strong> Three years of driving can easily wear tyres below the 1.6mm legal minimum, especially if you've done high mileage. Front tyres on front-wheel-drive cars wear fastest.</li>
                <li><strong>Windscreen damage (15% of first-MOT failures):</strong> Stone chips accumulate over three years of motorway driving. A chip larger than 10mm in the driver's swept area (zone A) or 40mm elsewhere will cause a failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Wiper blades (10% of first-MOT failures):</strong> Rubber perishes over time regardless of use. If your wipers smear or judder rather than clearing cleanly, replace them.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Your 10-minute pre-MOT check</h3>
            <p>Run through this quick checklist a week before your test:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Walk around the car and check every exterior light works (get someone to help with brake lights)</li>
                <li>Check tyre tread depth with a 20p coin &mdash; if you can see the outer band of the coin, the tread is too low</li>
                <li>Inspect the windscreen for chips and cracks</li>
                <li>Test the wipers &mdash; they should clear the screen without smearing</li>
                <li>Top up the washer fluid</li>
                <li>Press the horn to make sure it works</li>
                <li>Check all seatbelts retract and click properly</li>
                <li>Ensure all mirrors are present and secure</li>
            </ol>

            <p>For a more thorough inspection, see our <a href="/static/guides/mot-checklist.html" style="color: #e5c07b;">complete pre-MOT checklist with 15 items to check</a>.</p>

            <h2>What to Expect on the Day</h2>
            <p>Here's what happens when you take your car for its first MOT:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Arrive on time:</strong> Most test centres will ask you to arrive 5-10 minutes early. Bring your V5C logbook if possible (not legally required but helpful for identification).</li>
                <li><strong>The test takes 45-60 minutes:</strong> A qualified MOT tester will work through the standardised checklist. You don't need to be present during the test, but most centres allow you to watch if you'd like.</li>
                <li><strong>You'll get the result immediately:</strong> The tester will explain any issues found and provide a written report. Results are also uploaded to the DVSA database and can be checked online.</li>
                <li><strong>You'll receive a certificate:</strong> If your car passes, you'll get an MOT certificate (or confirmation that results are recorded digitally). Keep this safe &mdash; you'll need the certificate number for vehicle tax.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Possible outcomes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pass:</strong> Your vehicle met all requirements. Your MOT is valid for 12 months from the test date (or from the expiry date if tested within the early window).</li>
                <li><strong>Pass with advisories:</strong> Your car passed but the tester noted items that may become issues in the future. These are recorded for reference and don't affect your pass. Address them before your next MOT.</li>
                <li><strong>Fail with major defects:</strong> One or more items need repair before the vehicle can pass. You can still drive the car away (unless there are dangerous defects) and return for a retest.</li>
                <li><strong>Fail with dangerous defects:</strong> The vehicle has been identified as a direct and immediate risk to road safety. You cannot legally drive it until repaired.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Happens If Your New Car Fails?</h2>
            <p>Don't panic &mdash; even with a relatively new car, failures happen. Here's what to do:</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> If your car fails with a <strong>dangerous defect</strong>, you cannot legally drive it away from the test centre. You'll need to arrange repairs on-site or have the car recovered. This is rare for 3-year-old vehicles but can happen with severe tyre damage or major lighting failures.</p>
            </div>

            <p>For major (non-dangerous) defects, you have several options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Repair at the same garage:</strong> If the testing centre also does repairs, they can fix the issues and retest the relevant items. This is often the quickest option.</li>
                <li><strong>Leave and return within 10 working days:</strong> Take your car elsewhere for repairs and return to the same test centre within 10 working days for a <strong>free partial retest</strong>. Only the failed items are re-examined.</li>
                <li><strong>Full retest:</strong> If you return after 10 working days or to a different test centre, you'll need to pay for a complete new MOT test.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For first-MOT failures, the repair costs are usually modest. A blown bulb might cost under &pound;10. Even a pair of new tyres typically costs &pound;100-250 depending on size and brand. See our <a href="/static/guides/mot-cost.html" style="color: #e5c07b;">complete guide to MOT costs</a> for detailed repair price estimates.</p>

                <li><strong>Check all lights yourself first:</strong> This is the single most effective thing you can do. Ask someone to press the brake pedal and operate the indicators while you walk around the car checking every light.</li>
                <li><strong>Check tyre tread and condition:</strong> Use the 20p coin test on all four tyres, checking across the full width of the tread. Also look for any cuts, bulges, or cracks in the sidewalls.</li>
                <li><strong>Top up washer fluid:</strong> An empty washer bottle is a guaranteed failure. It takes 30 seconds to top up.</li>
                <li><strong>Replace wiper blades if worn:</strong> After 3 years, most wiper blades need replacing. New blades cost &pound;10-25 and are easy to fit yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Get windscreen chips repaired:</strong> Most insurers cover chip repairs for free. Don't wait &mdash; small chips can spread into cracks that are more expensive to fix.</li>
                <li><strong>Book with time to spare:</strong> Book your MOT 2-4 weeks before the due date. This gives you time to fix any issues and rebook a retest if needed, without your MOT expiring.</li>
                <li><strong>Use AutoSafe to check your risk:</strong> Enter your registration on our <a href="/" style="color: #e5c07b;">homepage</a> to see which components are most likely to cause issues for your specific vehicle.</li>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>When does a new car need its first MOT?</h3>
                    <p>New cars need their first MOT exactly 3 years after their date of first registration. This is the date shown on your V5C logbook, not when you purchased the car. After the first MOT, an annual test is required every year.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do new cars need an MOT after 3 years?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. All cars require their first MOT by the third anniversary of their registration date. There are no extensions or grace periods. After the first test, you need an annual MOT every year to keep driving legally.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the failure rate for first MOTs?</h3>
                    <p>Approximately 15% of vehicles fail their first MOT at 3 years old. While this is well below the national average of 28%, it still means roughly 1 in 7 nearly-new cars fail. The most common first-MOT failures are lighting issues, tyre problems, and windscreen damage.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I get an MOT before my car is 3 years old?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, you can get a voluntary MOT at any time, even before the 3-year mark. However, it won't count as your official first MOT. Your legally required MOT is due by the third anniversary of registration. You can book your first required MOT up to one month (minus a day) before the due date without losing any validity.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What should I check before my first MOT?</h3>
                    <p>Before your first MOT, check all exterior lights (headlights, brake lights, indicators, number plate light), tyre tread depth (minimum 1.6mm), windscreen for chips or cracks, wiper blades for wear, washer fluid level, and horn operation. These are the most common first-MOT failure areas and most can be checked in under 10 minutes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What does the MOT test actually check?</h3>
                    <p>The MOT test checks over 100 items including lights and signalling, steering, suspension, brakes, tyres, seatbelts, windscreen and wipers, exhaust emissions, body and structure, mirrors, horn, fuel system, and electrical equipment. The test takes approximately 45 to 60 minutes. It does not check engine condition, clutch, gearbox, or general mechanical performance.</p>
