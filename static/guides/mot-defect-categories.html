A major defect may affect safety or the environment but does not pose an immediate risk — you can still drive the vehicle to a garage for repair, though it is not advisable to use it as your daily vehicle until fixed. A dangerous defect represents a direct and immediate risk to road safety — you should not drive the vehicle at all until the defect is repaired, except directly to a pre-booked repair appointment. For example, a brake pad worn below minimum thickness is major, while a completely missing brake pad is dangerous."

            <h1>MOT Defect Categories Explained: Minor, Major &amp; Dangerous</h1>
            <p>Since May 2018, every MOT defect found during testing is classified into one of three categories: Minor, Major, or Dangerous. Understanding these categories helps you know exactly what your MOT result means, what action you need to take, and how urgently you need to address any issues found.</p>

            <h2>The Three MOT Defect Categories</h2>
            <p>The current defect classification system was introduced on <strong>20 May 2018</strong> as part of an EU directive on periodic roadworthiness testing. It replaced the older, simpler pass/fail system and provides vehicle owners with much more useful information about the condition of their car.</p>
            <p>Before 2018, a vehicle either passed, failed, or passed with advisories. The new system gives a clearer picture of how serious each issue is, which helps you prioritise repairs and understand whether your car is safe to drive.</p>

            <table class="data-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Category</th>
                        <th>MOT Result</th>
                        <th>Can You Drive?</th>
                        <th>Action Needed</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Minor</strong></td>
                        <td>Pass</td>
                        <td>Yes</td>
                        <td>Monitor and repair when convenient</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Major</strong></td>
                        <td>Fail</td>
                        <td>Yes, but repair promptly</td>
                        <td>Must repair and retest</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Dangerous</strong></td>
                        <td>Fail</td>
                        <td>No &mdash; unsafe to drive</td>
                        <td>Must repair before driving</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h2>Minor Defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A minor defect has no significant effect on the safety of the vehicle or its impact on the environment.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Key point:</strong> Your car still <strong>passes</strong> the MOT with minor defects. They are recorded on your MOT certificate as advisories.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Minor defects serve as early warnings. They tell you that a component is beginning to deteriorate but has not yet reached a point where it affects safety. If you ignore a minor defect, there is a good chance it will become a major defect by your next MOT.</p>

            <h3>Examples of Minor Defects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brake pad slightly worn</strong> &mdash; still above minimum thickness but getting close to the limit</li>
                <li><strong>Minor oil leak</strong> &mdash; visible seepage but not dripping onto the ground</li>
                <li><strong>Small stone chip on windscreen</strong> &mdash; outside the driver's direct line of sight and smaller than the failure threshold</li>
                <li><strong>Slight corrosion on a body panel</strong> &mdash; surface rust that has not affected structural integrity</li>
                <li><strong>Tyre tread wearing unevenly</strong> &mdash; tread is still above 1.6mm but the wear pattern suggests alignment or suspension issues</li>
                <li><strong>Number plate slightly faded</strong> &mdash; still legible but showing signs of deterioration</li>
                <li><strong>Headlight lens slightly clouded</strong> &mdash; light output still acceptable but reduced from new</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What to Do About Minor Defects</h3>
            <p>You do not need to repair minor defects immediately, but you should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Note them down and plan repairs before your next MOT</li>
                <li>Monitor them for worsening &mdash; a small oil leak can become a large one</li>
                <li>Consider addressing them during your next routine service to save on labour costs</li>
                <li>Check your MOT history online to see if the same advisory has appeared in previous years (indicating a persistent issue)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Major Defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A major defect may affect the vehicle's safety, put other road users at risk, or have a significant impact on the environment.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Key point:</strong> Your car <strong>fails</strong> the MOT. You must have the defect repaired and the vehicle retested before you can obtain a valid MOT certificate.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Major defects are the most common reason for MOT failures. They represent issues that have reached a level where they genuinely affect the safety or environmental compliance of your vehicle. While you can technically still drive a car with a major defect (it is not classified as immediately dangerous), you should get it repaired as soon as possible. Some models are more prone to specific major defects than others &mdash; for example, the <a href="/mot-check/ford/fiesta/" style="color: #e5c07b;">Ford Fiesta</a> and <a href="/mot-check/vauxhall/corsa/" style="color: #e5c07b;">Vauxhall Corsa</a> frequently pick up major defects on lighting and suspension, while the <a href="/mot-check/volkswagen/golf/" style="color: #e5c07b;">VW Golf</a> and <a href="/mot-check/bmw/3-series/" style="color: #e5c07b;">BMW 3 Series</a> are more likely to see emissions-related majors.</p>

            <h3>Examples of Major Defects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brake pad below minimum thickness</strong> &mdash; worn past the safe limit but still partially present</li>
                <li><strong>Tyre tread below 1.6mm</strong> &mdash; below the legal minimum across the central three-quarters of the tread</li>
                <li><strong>Headlight not working</strong> &mdash; one or more headlights completely failed</li>
                <li><strong>Exhaust emissions above the limit</strong> &mdash; catalytic converter or DPF not functioning efficiently</li>
                <li><strong>Shock absorber leaking</strong> &mdash; visible oil leak from a shock absorber with reduced damping</li>
                <li><strong>Windscreen crack in the driver's view</strong> &mdash; damage larger than 10mm in the driver's critical view area</li>
                <li><strong>Brake hose deteriorated</strong> &mdash; showing signs of cracking or bulging but not yet leaking</li>
                <li><strong>Steering rack boot split</strong> &mdash; protective boot torn, exposing the rack to contamination</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Retest Process</h3>
            <p>When your vehicle fails with a major defect, you have the following options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Repair at the testing centre:</strong> Many MOT stations also carry out repairs. If the work is done the same day, they can retest immediately</li>
                <li><strong>Free partial retest:</strong> If you return to the <strong>same</strong> testing centre within <strong>10 working days</strong>, you are entitled to a free partial retest on the failed items only</li>
                <li><strong>Full retest elsewhere:</strong> If you go to a different garage for repairs, you will need to pay for a full retest at that centre</li>
                <li><strong>Leave and return:</strong> You can leave the vehicle at the testing centre, have it repaired elsewhere, and return within the 10-day window for the free retest</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Dangerous Defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A dangerous defect represents a direct and immediate risk to road safety or has a serious impact on the environment.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Key point:</strong> Your car <strong>fails</strong> and is considered <strong>unsafe to drive</strong>. You must not drive it on public roads until the dangerous defect has been repaired. The only exception is driving directly to a pre-booked repair appointment.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Dangerous defects are the most severe category. They indicate that something on your vehicle could cause an accident or serious harm if you were to drive it. These defects are relatively uncommon compared to major defects, but they are taken very seriously. Older vehicles and those with poor <a href="/guides/mot-history-check" style="color: #e5c07b;">MOT history records</a> are more likely to receive dangerous defects, particularly for corrosion-related issues on models like the <a href="/mot-check/ford/focus/" style="color: #e5c07b;">Ford Focus</a> and <a href="/mot-check/peugeot/208/" style="color: #e5c07b;">Peugeot 208</a>.</p>

            <h3>Examples of Dangerous Defects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brake pad completely missing or detached</strong> &mdash; no braking friction material on one or more wheels</li>
                <li><strong>Structural corrosion in a critical area</strong> &mdash; rust has compromised a load-bearing component such as a sill, subframe, or suspension mounting point</li>
                <li><strong>Tyre with exposed cord</strong> &mdash; the rubber has worn through to the structural cords beneath, risking a blowout</li>
                <li><strong>Steering component about to fail</strong> &mdash; a ball joint or track rod end with excessive and dangerous play</li>
                <li><strong>Brake line severely corroded or leaking</strong> &mdash; risk of complete brake failure</li>
                <li><strong>Seat not secured to the floor</strong> &mdash; seat mounting bolts missing or anchor points corroded through</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel leak</strong> &mdash; visible fuel dripping, creating a fire risk</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Happens After a Dangerous Defect</h3>
            <p>If your vehicle receives a dangerous defect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The tester will advise you that the car is unsafe to drive</li>
                <li>The dangerous defect is recorded on the DVSA database and appears on your MOT history</li>
                <li>You should arrange for the vehicle to be repaired at the testing centre or transported to a garage</li>
                <li>If you must drive to a pre-booked repair appointment, keep the journey as short as possible and drive with extreme caution</li>
                <li>Driving a vehicle with a known dangerous defect could be treated as a criminal offence and will likely invalidate your motor insurance</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Replaced the Old System?</h2>
            <p>Before May 2018, the MOT used a simpler system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pass:</strong> No issues found, or only advisory items noted</li>
                <li><strong>Fail:</strong> One or more items did not meet the required standard</li>
                <li><strong>Advisory:</strong> An item was noted as beginning to deteriorate but did not constitute a failure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The problem with the old system was that it did not differentiate between a relatively minor failure (like a blown indicator bulb) and a life-threatening issue (like a corroded brake line). Both simply showed as "fail".</p>
            <p>The new three-tier system was introduced following <strong>EU Directive 2014/45/EU</strong> on periodic roadworthiness testing. Even after Brexit, the UK has retained this system because it provides genuinely useful information for vehicle owners and improves road safety.</p>

            <h2>How Defect Categories Affect Your MOT Certificate</h2>
            <p>Your MOT certificate and online MOT history now show much more detail than before. For each defect found, you will see:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>component</strong> affected (e.g., "Nearside front brake pad")</li>
                <li>The <strong>defect description</strong> (e.g., "Worn close to the minimum thickness")</li>
                <li>The <strong>category</strong> &mdash; Minor, Major, or Dangerous</li>
                <li>Any <strong>advisory notes</strong> providing additional context</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can view your full MOT history, including all defects from previous years, on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-mot-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOV.UK MOT history checker</a>. This is a useful way to track recurring issues and spot components that are deteriorating over time. You can also use <a href="/will-my-car-pass-mot/" style="color: #e5c07b;">AutoSafe's free AI prediction tool</a> to see how your defect history affects your overall failure risk, or <a href="/mot-check/" style="color: #e5c07b;">browse MOT data by make and model</a> to compare how your car stacks up against others.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Before your next MOT, check your previous MOT history online. Any advisory items from last year are the components most likely to fail this time around. Addressing them proactively can save you the cost and hassle of a failure.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is a minor defect on an MOT?</h3>
                    <p>A minor defect on an MOT is an issue that has no significant effect on the safety of the vehicle or its impact on the environment. Your car still passes the MOT with minor defects. They are recorded on your MOT certificate as advisories, serving as an early warning that a component may need attention before the next test. Examples include a slightly worn brake pad that is still above minimum thickness, a minor oil leak with no dripping, or a small stone chip on the windscreen outside the driver's direct line of sight.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can you fail an MOT for a minor defect?</h3>
                    <p>No, you cannot fail an MOT for a minor defect. Minor defects are recorded on your MOT certificate, but your vehicle still passes the test. Only Major and Dangerous defects cause an MOT failure. However, a minor defect can become a major defect by the time of your next MOT if it is not addressed, so it is wise to monitor or repair minor items when convenient.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What happens if you get a dangerous defect?</h3>
                    <p>If your vehicle receives a dangerous defect, it fails the MOT and is considered unsafe to drive. You should not drive the vehicle on public roads until the dangerous defect has been repaired. The only exception is driving directly to a pre-booked repair appointment. Driving a vehicle with a known dangerous defect is illegal and could invalidate your insurance. The defect will be recorded on the DVSA database, and you will need to have the repair completed and the vehicle retested before it can be used on the road.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>When were MOT defect categories introduced?</h3>
                    <p>The current MOT defect categories &mdash; Minor, Major, and Dangerous &mdash; were introduced on 20 May 2018. This change was part of a broader update to align UK MOT testing with EU Directive 2014/45/EU on periodic roadworthiness testing. Before this date, the MOT used a simpler pass/fail system with advisory notes. The new categories provide more detailed information about the severity of issues found during testing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the difference between major and dangerous?</h3>
                    <p>Both major and dangerous defects cause an MOT failure, but they differ in severity and what you can do afterwards. A major defect may affect safety or the environment but does not pose an immediate risk &mdash; you can still drive the vehicle to a garage for repair, though it is not advisable to use it as your daily vehicle until fixed. A dangerous defect represents a direct and immediate risk to road safety &mdash; you should not drive the vehicle at all until the defect is repaired, except directly to a pre-booked repair appointment. For example, a brake pad worn below minimum thickness is major, while a completely missing brake pad is dangerous.</p>
