<h2>What Percentage of Cars Fail Their MOT?</h2>

<div class="stat-highlight">
    <div class="big-number">{{ "%.0f"|format(national_avg_fail_rate * 100) }}%</div>
    <div class="label">National average MOT failure rate</div>
</div>

<p>Every year, approximately <strong>{{ "%.0f"|format(national_avg_fail_rate * 100) }}% of vehicles fail their MOT</strong> in the United Kingdom. That means nearly 1 in 3 cars, vans, and motorcycles presented for testing are found to have defects serious enough to warrant a failure. It is one of the most common — and most dreaded — motoring experiences for UK drivers.</p>

<p>However, the headline figure disguises significant variation depending on your vehicle's age. Failure rates differ substantially across different age brackets:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>First-time MOT (3 years old):</strong> Approximately 15% failure rate. These vehicles are relatively new and tend to have fewer wear-related issues, though lighting and tyre defects still catch owners out.</li>
    <li><strong>6 to 10 years old:</strong> Around 18% failure rate. By this stage, components such as suspension bushes, brake discs, and exhaust systems are beginning to show meaningful wear.</li>
    <li><strong>10 to 15 years old:</strong> Roughly 20% failure rate. Corrosion, structural deterioration, and cumulative component wear become increasingly significant.</li>
    <li><strong>15+ years old:</strong> Failure rates climb further, with body and chassis corrosion becoming a dominant factor, particularly for vehicles in coastal and northern regions.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that MOT failure rates have been broadly stable over the past decade, though the introduction of the new defect categorisation system in May 2018 changed what gets recorded and how. Before 2018, a defect was either a pass or a fail. Since 2018, defects are classified as minor (advisory), major (failure), or dangerous (immediate prohibition). This means that "failure" now specifically refers to major and dangerous defects only — minor defects are recorded as advisories and do not cause a failure.</p>

<p>The practical implication is that your vehicle might receive several advisory notices and still pass its MOT. Conversely, a single major defect — such as a headlight bulb that has blown on the way to the testing station — is enough to trigger a failure, regardless of how well-maintained the rest of the vehicle may be.</p>

<h2>What Affects Your MOT Failure Risk?</h2>

<p>Whether your car passes or fails its MOT is not simply a matter of luck. There are seven key factors that determine the outcome, and understanding them can help you take targeted action before your test date.</p>

<h3>1. Vehicle Age</h3>
<p>Age is the single strongest predictor of MOT failure. Older vehicles have higher failure rates, with a particularly sharp increase between the 3-5 year and 6-10 year age bands. This is when many original-fit components — particularly suspension parts, brake components, and exhaust systems — reach the end of their service life. The relationship between age and failure risk is not linear; it accelerates as vehicles enter their second decade.</p>

<h3>2. Mileage</h3>
<p>High-mileage vehicles wear through components faster, especially brakes, suspension, and tyres. A vehicle that has covered 100,000 miles in five years will typically have a higher failure risk than a same-age vehicle with 30,000 miles. Mileage affects wear-related components disproportionately — brakes and suspension bear the brunt of high-mileage use, whilst electrical components are less directly affected by distance travelled.</p>

<h3>3. Make and Model</h3>
<p>Some vehicle models are significantly more reliable than others when it comes to MOT testing. At the extremes, certain models fail at rates above 38%, whilst others pass more than 95% of the time. This variation reflects differences in build quality, component durability, design choices, and the typical owner profile for each model. Japanese manufacturers, for example, tend to have lower failure rates on average than some European brands, though there are notable exceptions in both directions.</p>

<h3>4. Previous MOT History</h3>
<p>Vehicles that have failed a previous MOT are statistically more likely to fail again, particularly if advisories from prior tests were not addressed. A pattern of repeated advisories in the same area — such as brake wear warnings that go unactioned for multiple test cycles — is a strong indicator of an upcoming failure. Our AI model pays particular attention to advisory trends over time, as these reveal the trajectory of component deterioration.</p>

<h3>5. Component Wear Patterns</h3>
<p>Every vehicle type has characteristic weak points that testers see repeatedly. French cars, for instance, tend to have higher rates of lighting and electrical failures. German vehicles often present with suspension issues, particularly those fitted with complex multi-link rear suspension systems. Understanding your specific vehicle's common failure points allows you to focus your pre-MOT inspection on the areas most likely to cause problems.</p>

<h3>6. Time Since Last MOT</h3>
<p>Longer gaps between MOT tests correlate with higher failure rates. Vehicles that are tested promptly — within a few days of their due date — tend to perform better than those that have been off the road for extended periods. This is partly because vehicles that sit unused develop issues such as seized brakes, flat-spotted tyres, and corroded electrical connections. It also reflects the fact that owners who are attentive to their MOT date tend to be more attentive to maintenance generally.</p>

<h3>7. Regional Variation</h3>
<p>Where you live matters. Coastal areas and northern regions of the UK see significantly more corrosion-related failures due to salt air and heavier winter road salt application. A vehicle that lives its life in the south-east of England will typically have lower corrosion-related failure rates than an identical vehicle based in coastal Scotland or the north-east of England. Our prediction model incorporates regional corrosion indices based on your postcode to account for this factor.</p>

<h2>MOT Failure Rates by Car Make and Model</h2>

<p>The table below shows the 20 most-tested vehicle models in our database, along with their overall MOT failure rates. These figures are weighted averages across all age and mileage bands, giving a fair picture of each model's real-world reliability at MOT time.</p>

<table class="data-table">

</table>

<p>These are the 20 most-tested models in our database. <a href="/mot-check/" style="color: #e5c07b;">Browse all 400+ makes and models &rarr;</a></p>

<p>The spread in failure rates across different models is striking. Some of the most popular vehicles in the UK — those with millions of tests in the database — sit well above the national average, whilst others comfortably outperform it. If you are buying a used car and MOT reliability matters to you, these figures are worth considering alongside traditional reliability surveys.</p>

<h2>Most Common MOT Failure Reasons in 2026</h2>

<p>Across all vehicles in our database, the following components account for the largest share of MOT failures. Understanding which areas cause the most problems nationally can help you prioritise your pre-MOT checks.</p>

<table class="data-table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Component</th>
            <th>Avg. Failure Risk</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        {% for comp in top_components %}
        <tr>
            <td>{{ comp.name }}</td>
            <td><span class="fail-rate">{{ "%.1f"|format(comp.avg_risk * 100) }}%</span></td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Let us look at each of these component areas in more detail:</p>

<h3>Lamps, Reflectors and Electrical Equipment</h3>
<p>Lighting and electrical faults are consistently the single biggest cause of MOT failure across the UK. The most common issues include blown bulbs (headlights, brake lights, indicators, and number plate lights), misaligned headlights, cracked or clouded lens covers, and faulty indicator or hazard light operation. Many of these are simple, inexpensive fixes — a replacement bulb costs a few pounds — but drivers often do not notice a blown bulb until it is pointed out. Walk around your vehicle with the lights on before your MOT to catch the obvious ones.</p>

<h3>Brakes</h3>
<p>Brake defects are among the most serious MOT failures and account for a substantial proportion of total failures. Common issues include worn brake pads and discs below minimum thickness, corroded or leaking brake lines, seized callipers (particularly on rear brakes), and a spongy or excessively long brake pedal travel. Brake performance is tested on a roller brake tester, which measures the force each brake generates and checks for imbalance between sides. Even if your brakes feel fine during normal driving, an imbalance or marginal pad thickness can trigger a failure.</p>

<h3>Suspension</h3>
<p>Suspension failures cover a broad range of components including shock absorbers (dampers), coil springs, anti-roll bar links and bushes, ball joints, and wheel bearings. Worn shock absorbers are particularly common on higher-mileage vehicles and may not be obvious during daily driving. Broken coil springs are another frequent finding — they often fracture at the bottom coil where road salt and moisture cause corrosion. A visual inspection under the vehicle can reveal broken springs, torn gaiters, and leaking dampers before they become MOT failures.</p>

<h3>Tyres</h3>
<p>Tyre defects account for a significant share of MOT failures and are one of the easiest areas to check yourself. The legal minimum tread depth is 1.6mm across the central three-quarters of the tread width, around the entire circumference. However, many tyres that pass at 1.6mm are close to failure, and uneven wear patterns (caused by misalignment or worn suspension) can leave patches below the limit even when the rest of the tyre looks fine. Sidewall damage — cuts, bulges, or exposed cords — is also a common failure point, particularly for vehicles driven on potholed roads.</p>

<h3>Visibility</h3>
<p>Visibility failures primarily involve the windscreen and wiper system. A windscreen chip or crack in the driver's "swept area" (the area cleared by the wipers, directly in the driver's line of sight) larger than 10mm will cause a failure. Outside the swept area, the limit is 40mm. Wiper blades that leave smears, streaks, or uncleared areas are also grounds for failure, as is a windscreen washer system that does not deliver fluid to the screen. These are typically cheap fixes but are easily overlooked.</p>

<h3>Body, Chassis and Structure</h3>
<p>Corrosion is the main concern in this category. The tester checks for structural rust — metal that has corroded to the point where it is weakened or holed — in load-bearing areas such as sills, subframes, suspension mounting points, and floor pans. Surface rust alone is not a failure, but rust that has penetrated through the metal or caused structural weakness will fail. Sharp edges caused by corrosion or accident damage that could injure a pedestrian are also grounds for failure. Vehicles in coastal and northern regions are disproportionately affected.</p>

<h3>Steering</h3>
<p>Steering failures include worn track rod ends, damaged steering rack gaiters, excessive play in the steering system, and power steering fluid leaks. The tester checks for free play at the steering wheel — excessive movement before the road wheels respond — and for any knocking or looseness in the steering components. Worn steering parts can develop gradually, making them difficult for the driver to notice in day-to-day use, but they are readily apparent during a focused inspection.</p>

<h2>How Our AI MOT Prediction Works</h2>

<p>Our prediction system is built on the most comprehensive dataset available for UK vehicle testing. Here is how it works:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Data foundation:</strong> We have analysed <strong>{{ "{:,}".format(total_tests_analysed) }} MOT test records</strong> from the official DVSA (Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency) database. This covers every MOT test conducted at authorised test centres across the UK.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine learning model:</strong> Our CatBoost gradient boosting model uses <strong>104 engineered features</strong> to predict failure probability. These features encompass vehicle age, mileage, make and model patterns, previous test results, advisory history and trends, regional corrosion factors, temporal patterns, and neglect indicators.</li>
    <li><strong>Calibrated probabilities:</strong> The model is calibrated using Platt scaling to ensure that the percentage shown is a true probability — if we say there is a 35% chance of failure, approximately 35 out of 100 vehicles with that score will actually fail. This calibration is validated using expected calibration error (ECE) metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-time data:</strong> When you enter your registration number, we fetch your vehicle's complete MOT history from the DVSA MOT History API in real time. This means your prediction is based on your actual vehicle's age, mileage trajectory, previous test results, and outstanding advisories — not just a population average.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalised prediction:</strong> The result you receive is specific to your vehicle. Two identical models of the same age can receive very different risk scores based on their individual histories. A vehicle with a clean history and declining mileage will score differently from one with repeated advisories and increasing annual mileage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our approach is fully transparent about the data source. All MOT test data is sourced from the DVSA and used under the <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/" style="color: #e5c07b;">Open Government Licence v3.0</a>. We do not use any proprietary or undisclosed data sources.</p>

<h2>What to Do If Your Risk Score Is High</h2>

<p>If our prediction tool shows a high failure risk for your vehicle, do not panic. A high score is not a guarantee of failure — it is a signal to take action. Here are practical steps you can follow to improve your chances of passing:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Check the component breakdown:</strong> Our prediction includes a risk score for each individual component area (brakes, suspension, tyres, etc.). Focus your attention on whichever areas show the highest risk for your specific vehicle, rather than trying to check everything at once.</li>
    <li><strong>Do a visual inspection:</strong> Walk around your vehicle and check the basics yourself using our <a href="/guides/mot-checklist" style="color: #e5c07b;">pre-MOT checklist</a>. Many MOT failures — blown bulbs, worn wiper blades, low tyre tread — can be spotted and fixed without any mechanical expertise.</li>
    <li><strong>Address outstanding advisories:</strong> If your previous MOT listed advisory items, these are components that were noted as wearing but had not yet reached the failure threshold. By the time of your next test, some of these may have deteriorated enough to fail. Check your last MOT certificate and prioritise any advisories that were close to the limit.</li>
    <li><strong>Book a pre-MOT inspection:</strong> A pre-MOT check at a local garage typically costs between £20 and £30. The mechanic will examine the same items the MOT tester will check and can identify failures before your official test. This gives you time to get repairs done at a competitive price rather than under time pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>Allow time for repairs:</strong> Book your MOT 2 to 4 weeks before the due date so that you have time to arrange any necessary repairs if issues are found. You can have your MOT done up to one month (minus a day) before expiry without losing any time on your certificate.</li>
    <li><strong>Consider the costs:</strong> If multiple areas show high risk, it may be worth getting a repair estimate before committing. See our <a href="/guides/mot-cost" style="color: #e5c07b;">guide to MOT costs</a> for a breakdown of typical repair prices by component.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Understanding MOT Defect Categories</h2>

<p>Since May 2018, all MOT defects in the UK have been classified into three categories. Understanding these categories helps you interpret your MOT result and know what action is required.</p>

<h3>Minor Defects</h3>
<p>Minor defects have no significant impact on vehicle safety or the environment. They are recorded as advisories on your MOT certificate, but <strong>your car still passes</strong>. You are not legally required to repair minor defects, but they indicate areas of wear that may worsen before your next test. Example: a brake pad that is worn but still above the minimum thickness threshold.</p>

<h3>Major Defects</h3>
<p>Major defects cause an <strong>immediate MOT failure</strong>. The defect must be repaired before the vehicle can pass a retest. You may still drive the vehicle away from the testing station (unless it is also classified as dangerous), but it will not have a valid MOT certificate until the repairs are completed and verified. Example: a brake pad worn below the minimum specified thickness.</p>

<h3>Dangerous Defects</h3>
<p>Dangerous defects cause an <strong>immediate failure</strong> and the vehicle is considered a direct and immediate risk to road safety. You <strong>cannot legally drive the vehicle</strong> until the defect is repaired — it must be trailered or transported to a garage for repair. Driving a vehicle with a dangerous defect is a criminal offence. Example: a brake pad missing entirely, or a structural component so corroded that it could fail under load.</p>

<p>For a full explanation of how each category works and what it means for your vehicle, see our <a href="/guides/mot-defect-categories" style="color: #e5c07b;">MOT defect categories explained</a> guide.</p>

        <h3>What happens if my car fails its MOT?</h3>
        <p>If your car fails its MOT, you can get the necessary repairs done and return to the same test centre within 10 working days for a free partial retest (covering only the failed items). If you go to a different centre or exceed the 10-day window, you will need to pay for a full retest.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is it worth getting a pre-MOT check?</h3>
        <p>Yes. A pre-MOT inspection typically costs between £20 and £30 and can identify issues before the official test. This can save you hundreds of pounds in failed test fees and emergency repairs, and means you can shop around for the best repair prices rather than being under time pressure.</p>

        <h3>Do electric cars need an MOT?</h3>
        <p>Yes, electric vehicles (EVs) need an MOT after 3 years from first registration, the same as petrol and diesel cars. However, EVs skip the emissions test and typically have fewer mechanical failure points due to having fewer moving parts, regenerative braking reducing brake wear, and no exhaust system.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>When is my first MOT due?</h3>
        <p>New cars need their first MOT exactly 3 years after the date of registration. After the first test, an MOT is required annually. You can have your MOT done up to one month (minus a day) before the expiry date without losing any time on your certificate. See our <a href="/guides/first-mot-guide" style="color: #e5c07b;">first MOT guide</a> for more details.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How much does an MOT cost?</h3>
        <p>The maximum MOT fee is £54.85 for cars (set by the DVSA), though many garages charge less. However, the real cost of an MOT includes potential repair bills if your vehicle fails. The average repair cost following a failure is between £150 and £500, depending on the defects found. See our <a href="/guides/mot-cost" style="color: #e5c07b;">complete MOT cost guide</a> for a full breakdown.</p>

        <h3>What are the new MOT rules for 2026?</h3>
        <p>Key changes for 2026 include updated emissions standards and expanded testing requirements for electric and hybrid vehicles. The defect categorisation system (minor, major, dangerous) introduced in 2018 remains in place. See our <a href="/guides/mot-rules-2026" style="color: #e5c07b;">2026 MOT rules guide</a> for full details of the changes.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I drive without an MOT?</h3>
        <p>You can only legally drive a vehicle without a valid MOT certificate if you are driving directly to a pre-booked MOT test appointment. Driving without a valid MOT at any other time can result in a fine of up to £1,000, and your vehicle insurance may also be invalidated.</p>
